- When wanting to do new things, explore new ideas, sort of without thinking we ask someone for directions, step by step actions to take
and is due to some kind of indoctrination by formal education, when in reality just acting and failing repetively is how we can actually 
achive greatness not by following a manual. Circuling back to the indoctrination point, is easier to understand it with an example so here it
goes: A teacher is trying to explain something to a kid, trying to really make him understand it, but in the process or the normal way of doing 
it is by explaining and then trapping him inside a box so that he can do the thing without actually be able to expand upon it. (the teacher
is not the problem is not being evil, the point is that the cycle just continues if there's no other way of thing of the world aside
from the unchangeble place that most people think it is, everyone is trapped.) Is like asking for permission to take action.
